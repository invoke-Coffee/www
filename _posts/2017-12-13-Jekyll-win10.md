# Installing Jekyll on windows. 
I installed this based on the excellent guide on setting this up on Jekyll's site here. [https://jekyllrb.com/docs/windows/](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/windows/)

This is a overview of the commands that I run.

* Update system

``` bash
 sudo apt-get update -y && sudo apt-get upgrade -y

Hit:2 http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu xenial InRelease

```

* Update again for this new repository and install ruby. 

``` bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ruby2.3 ruby2.3-dev build-essential
``` 

* Update Gem

``` bash
sudo gem update
```

* Install Jekyll using Gem (trimed up the output)

``` bash
andrew@DESKTOP-SNCN8DQ:~$ sudo gem install jekyll bundler
Fetching: public_suffix-3.0.1.gem (100%)
Successfully installed public_suffix-3.0.1
Fetching: addressable-2.5.2.gem (100%)
```

* Success well that was easy !!

``` bash
andrew@DESKTOP-SNCN8DQ:~$ jekyll -v
jekyll 3.6.2
```

* Well close anyway I needed to also install minima and jekyll-feed

``` bash
andrew@DESKTOP-SNCN8DQ:~$ jekyll s -s /mnt/c/Users/MyUser/Documents/www/
Configuration file: /mnt/c/Users/MyUser/Documents/www/_config.yml
jekyll 3.6.2 | Error:  The minima theme could not be found.
andrew@DESKTOP-SNCN8DQ:~$ jekyll s -s /mnt/c/Users/MyUser/Documents/www/
Configuration file: /mnt/c/Users/MyUser/Documents/www/_config.yml
  Dependency Error: Yikes! It looks like you don't have jekyll-feed or one of its dependencies installed. In order to use Jekyll as currently configured, you'll need to install this gem. The full error message from Ruby is: 'cannot load such file -- jekyll-feed' If you run into trouble, you can find helpful resources at https://jekyllrb.com/help/!
jekyll 3.6.2 | Error:  jekyll-feed
andrew@DESKTOP-SNCN8DQ:~$ sudo gem install jekyll-feed

# Running Jekyll

This is where Bash on windows gets a bit interesting. You linux VM has its own separate file system and mounts your c drive under /mnt. If you try to change your working directory to your C drive is located Jekyll will not run. 

``` bash
andrew@DESKTOP-SNCN8DQ:/mnt/c/Users/MyUser/Documents/www$ jekyll s
/var/lib/gems/2.3.0/gems/bundler-1.16.0/lib/bundler/spec_set.rb:88:in `block in materialize': Could not find public_suffix-2.0.5 in any of the sources (Bundler::GemNotFound)
        from /var/lib/gems/2.3.0/gems/bundler-1.16.0/lib/bundler/spec_set.rb:82:in `map!'
        from /var/lib/gems/2.3.0/gems/bundler-1.16.0/lib/bundler/spec_set.rb:82:in `materialize'
        from /var/lib/gems/2.3.0/gems/bundler-1.16.0/lib/bundler/definition.rb:170:in `specs'
        from /var/lib/gems/2.3.0/gems/bundler-1.16.0/lib/bundler/definition.rb:237:in `specs_for'
        from /var/lib/gems/2.3.0/gems/bundler-1.16.0/lib/bundler/definition.rb:226:in `requested_specs'
        from /var/lib/gems/2.3.0/gems/bundler-1.16.0/lib/bundler/runtime.rb:108:in `block in definition_method'
        from /var/lib/gems/2.3.0/gems/bundler-1.16.0/lib/bundler/runtime.rb:20:in `setup'
        from /var/lib/gems/2.3.0/gems/bundler-1.16.0/lib/bundler.rb:107:in `setup'
        from /var/lib/gems/2.3.0/gems/jekyll-3.6.2/lib/jekyll/plugin_manager.rb:50:in `require_from_bundler'
        from /var/lib/gems/2.3.0/gems/jekyll-3.6.2/exe/jekyll:11:in `<top (required)>'
        from /usr/local/bin/jekyll:23:in `load'
        from /usr/local/bin/jekyll:23:in `<main>'
andrew@DESKTOP-SNCN8DQ:/mnt/c/Users/MyUser/Documents/www$
```

So you will need to stay in the linux file system and tell jekyll where to find the files (assuming you are storing them on the c drive)

``` bash
andrew@DESKTOP-SNCN8DQ:~$ jekyll s -s /mnt/c/Users/MyUser/Documents/www/
Configuration file: /mnt/c/Users/MyUser/Documents/www/_config.yml
            Source: /mnt/c/Users/MyUser/Documents/www/
       Destination: /home/andrew/_site

                    If it does not work, please upgrade Bash on Windows or run Jekyll with --no-watch.
