One of the background things that you rellly donâ€™t think about untill it is a problem is Time Syncronization.

The standard method to ensure that you have the correct time is Network Time Protocal (NTP).

In linux this is comanaly already installed with your distrubution.

## Verification

you can verify that both NTP is installed and operating with

``` sh
ntpq -p
```

you should see something like this
``` sh
remote           refid      st t when poll reach   delay   offset  jitter
==============================================================================
*pool-test.ntp.o 216.218.192.202  2 u  826 1024  377    1.558    2.208   2.816
+96.44.142.5     63.145.169.3     2 u  436 1024  377   46.977    2.289   3.186
+ns1.your-site.c 198.82.1.202     3 u  803 1024  377   76.805    2.900   2.753
ec2-54-88-192-6 .INIT.          16 u   5d 1024    0   81.509    3.510   0.000
```
if you get this back NTP is installed and working.

## configuration

For the most part the default settings will do everything you want. but if you want to change some settings you can find the config file at.

``` /etc/ntp.conf ```

(Be sure to restart the ntp service to reload the configuration after makeing changes.)
