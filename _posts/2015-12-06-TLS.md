I started offering SSL/TLS on my site with lets encrypt beta certificates, now I wanted to move to enforcing SSL/TLS.

For this I will be using mod_rewrite.

First I enabled mod_rewite
``` sh
sudo a2enmod rewrite
```
Then edit /etc/apache2/apache2.conf and add
``` sh
RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{HTTPS} off
RewriteRule (.*) https://%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI}
```
The restart Apache and test
``` sh
sudo systemctl restart apache2
```
Now all requests will have the URL rewritten to include https://
