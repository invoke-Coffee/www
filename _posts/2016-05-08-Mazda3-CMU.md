I recently purchased a mazda 3 2016 and one of the things that I was most excited with is the infotainment  system.

I am planning on a serious of posts detailing my journey to hack and modify my infotainment system so far my priories are.

- Gain SSH access
- Disable speed restrictions. (to allow passengers to interact)
- Lower warning times. (seriously how many times do I need to see that)
- Change backgrounds.
- Increase functionality.

Good resources
