First thing that you will need to do to start modifying the Mazda CMU is to gain SSH Access.

- You will need a compatible USB to Ethernet adapter.
  - [Here is the one that I used.](http://www.amazon.com/Plugable-Ethernet-Network-Adapter-Chromebook/dp/B00484IEJS?ie=UTF8&psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00)
    - Mazda hacks has some other options, http://mazda3hacks.com/doku.php?id=notes:sshnotes
    - Connect this up to a consumer router (or ethernet hub and an DHCP server for networking geeks)
    - SSH into the Ip address that the CMU was assigned (look into the DHCP leases or connected clients)
      - User : root
      - Pass : jcI

And that is it. There is a bunch of modification that you can do now but this is the start.
