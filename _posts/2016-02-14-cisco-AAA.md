I spent quite a bit of time integrating some nexus switches into Cisco ACS. So wanted to share a couple of notes. I will be talking a lot about NX-OS RBAC rolls so here is a good primer if you are not familiar with it.

[http://routing-bits.com/2011/05/24/nexus-user-roles/](http://routing-bits.com/2011/05/24/nexus-user-roles/)

## Network-operator is the default role.
If your AAA Server doesn’t define any role for the Authenticated user you will get Netw0rk-Operator by default.

## Locally defined roles (authorization) will take effect.
So if a Tacas user is authenticated and has the same username as a locally defined user account. The local user role will take effect.

## Shell roles
From ACS you need to return shell roles to define the authorization form TACAS. The attributes you want are.

```
Attribute: cisco-av-pair
Requirement: Mandatory
Value: shell:roles*”network-admin vdc-admin”
```
