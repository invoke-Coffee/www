- In part 1 I laid out the general configuration that I will be disusing through this series of posts.
- In Part 2 I discussed ISAKMP polices.
- Part 3 I discussed  Transform-sets
- Part 3 I will wrap it up and go over the last parts.

## Pre-shared key
As we are using a pre-shared key we need to define that. in practice you will want to use a much better key than **vpnuser**.
```
crypto isakmp key vpnuser address 172.16.1.1
```
## Access-list
We will be using a access-list to match on traffic we would like to go through the tunnel. Nothing extensive here just a basic ACL.
```
access-list 100 permit ip 172.16.2.0 0.0.0.255 10.1.1.0 0.0.0.255
```
One thing to note any traffic not bound to the remote end of the tunnel will not be encrypted.

## Crypto map
Our crypto map is what will tie all of these together and be used to apply them to an interface.
```
crypto map mymap 10 ipsec-isakmp
     set peer 172.16.1.1 ! Remote end of the tunnel
     set transform-set myset ! using the transform set we defined earlier.
     match address 100 ! encrypt any traffic matching this ACL
```
The 10 is the priority number this would come into play if you have multiple crypto maps.

The last part is applying this map to an interface
```
interface FastEthernet0/1
      ip address 10.0.0.2 255.255.255.0
      crypto map mymap
```


This is the end of this multi part guide. I hope that you found this helpful. In the future I will be doing some posts about using RSA keys vs pre-shared keys.
