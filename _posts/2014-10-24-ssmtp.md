I happened to need a simple tool to enable outgoing email from a Linux server.
I discovered SSMTP as extremely simple tool for outgoing email.

to install (on Debian based systems)

``` sh
Apt-Get install SSMTP
```

Then configure by editing /etc/ssmtp/ssmtp.conf


``` sh
EDIT(

A couple of recommendations that I found later
UseTLS=YES
UseSTARTTLS=YES
```
 

you can also test with mail

mail me@test

(end with . and enter)

)
